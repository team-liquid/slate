# Introduction

This is the official documentation for Liquid Gold's API. This is meant to be private information and should not be shared.

Liquid Gold is the core API responsible for all fan-based interaction event tracking. At its core, Liquid Gold is responsible for point assignment and distribution. It allows any and all registered Team Liquid users to be rewarded for their interactions with Team Liquid whether that is via Twitch.tv, Youtube, Discord, Instragram, Facebook, and other social media platforms.

The API only supports end points pertaining to a specific user specified. You cannot view points of more than one user at a time.

To view the details of the interaction that awarded the points, that needs to be done through the API of the platform service.
